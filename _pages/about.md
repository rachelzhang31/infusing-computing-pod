Jep 'n Jabber is BLAH BLAH BLAH. 

The purpose of this podcast is to BLAH BLAH BLAH. Welcome to the podcast!

### Our Goal

Jep 'n Jabber's goal is to bring vegetables to the people. We've done so by BLAH, BLAH, and BLAH.

The end result is a podcast series that focuses on four core truths:
- Popeyes does not have green beans.
- KFC does not have green beans.
- Some of us are OK with canned green beans, and others aren't. 
- Bacon is always a good idea.
